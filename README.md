## NJ Carbon Dividend Calculator
By the year 2100, climate change could force 100s of thousands of NJ citizens to evacuate the coa\
stline.

20 students at Princeton are working with state legislators to put a price on carbon in New Jerse\
y.
The policy places a fee on fossil fuels. The majority of revenue is returned to households as div\
idends to handle the increased energy costs. Economists and politicans of both parties support th\
is policy.

How would this policy affect your family? Estimating an individualâ€™s net monetary gain or loss is\
 a technical and laborious process that the average NJ citizen might not have the time for.
This is where our project, the Carbon Dividend Calculator, comes in.

Our simple web app takes in user energy information and outputs the impact on their bottom line.
We provide personalized information in a transparent and nonpartisan way.
Our vision is a clear, intuitive app that empowers thousands of users to better understand and ad\
apt to this new carbon policy.

## Download guide:
1. Create a new directory, start a virtualenv (make sure you're using Python3!)
```
mkdir ~/njcdc_calc
virtualenv njcdc
source njcdc/bin/activate
```
To ensure you are using Python 3.6, you can run
```
virtualenv njcdc -p /usr/bin/python3.6 njcdc
```
2. Clone this directory
```
git clone git@github.com:lujonathanh/njcdc.git
```
3. Install dependencies
```
pip install Django==2.0.5
pip install whitenoise
```
4. Move local settings to a settings file
```
cd ~/njcdc_calc/njcdc 
mv njcdc/settings.py njcdc/settings_original.py
mv njcdc/settings_local_template.py njcdc/settings.py
```

5. To populate your database with data for NJ zip codes, run

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py shell < data/populate_database.py
```

6. Run manage.py
```
cd ~/njcdc_calc/njcdc
python manage.py runserver 8000
```
This will activate the website on the chosen port 8000 (you can change this number)
