  <h2>The Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The proposed policy puts a fee of {{ fee_label }} per metric ton of carbon dioxide on fossil fuels in New Jersey.

      For example, {{ gasoline_example_label }} outputs about {{ gasoline_example_co2 }} tons of CO2 per {{ gasoline_example_unit }},
      so the fee increase on a {{ gasoline_example_unit }} of {{ gasoline_example_label }} is  {{ gasoline_example_co2 }} * {{ fee_label }} = ${{ gasoline_example_fee }}.
    </p>
  <h2>Who pays?</h2>
  <p>
  This fee is paid at the first point of sale of fuels into New Jersey; the company importing the fuel would pay. This ensures that all fuels are covered in a simple way.

      While ordinary citizens won't directly pay the fee, companies almost surely will have to increase the
  price of affected products. In our calculator, we make the conservative assumption that the entire
  burden of the fee gets passed along to consumers.
  </p>
    <h2>Who gets money back?</h2>
  <p>
    {{rebate_label}} of the fee's revenue will be returned equally to all NJ citizens in the form of a tax credit.

      The amount is based on the number of adults in the household, where children (under 18) receive {{ CHILD_MULTIPLIER }} times of what the adult receives.</p> <p>
      We estimate an adult would receive {{ benefit_per_adult }} per month. For example, a house with {{ household_example_adults }} adults and {{ household_example_children}} children
      would receive {{ household_example_benefit }} per month.


  </p>
  <h2>What about the rest of the money?</h2>
  <p>

  The remaining {{ remainder_label }} will go to investments in sustainable infrastructure, as well as providing transitional assistance to vulnerable,
      energy-intensive businesses.
